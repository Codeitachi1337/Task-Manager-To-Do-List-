# Task-Manager-To-Do-List-
Hey, this is my first project a simple to do list which allows the user to add tasks, view them and remove them once complete. 

I took around 2 hours to make with light help from ChatGPT as I am a self taught beginner, still struggling to understand code but slowly getting there.  Any feedback and tips for learning are much appreciated  :)
